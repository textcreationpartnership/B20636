            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Considerations Humbly Offered <hi>To the Honourable House of</hi> Commons, <hi>by the Planters, in relation to the Bill to settle the Trade to</hi> Africa.</head>
            <p>THAT it being of so great Importance to this Nation to Encourage and Support the Plantations, it will be of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Necessity to have them plentifully supplied with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, by whose Labour and Strength all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of those Countries are produced, which Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is all clear Gains to this Nation, and better than the Mines of Gold and Silver are to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not a Negro but produces as much Commodity, either Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Indigo, Tobacco, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as will load one Tun of Shipping, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of which Product will also largely encrease the Consumption of the <hi>English</hi> Woollen Manufacture, and augment the Revenue of the Crown.</p>
            <p>A great Quantity of the Product of our Plantation-Commodities, will enable the <hi>English</hi> Merchant to make large Exportations to Forreign Markets, and put them into a Capacity to undersell all other Nations that vye with us in the same Commodities, which will not only discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their Plantations, but greatly encourage our own.</p>
            <p>Since the <hi>African</hi> Company are so very desirous to be Establisht, the better, as they say, to preserve the Gold Trade, and demand a Duty to maintain their Forts and Castles at <hi>Gambio,</hi> and on the Gold Coast: We the Planters do say, that we are willing to pay such a Duty as this Honourable House shall deem necessary for the Trade to <hi>Gambio</hi> and the Gold Coast; <hi>viz.</hi> from Cape <hi>Blanco</hi> to the River <hi>Vultus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore since the Plantations are not against paying a Duty for that Trade, they Humbly hope, that what is of undoubted Necessity for their Support, may be had cheap, plentiful and easie; desiring only that the Coast from River <hi>Vultus</hi> to <hi>Angola,</hi> and Cape <hi>Good-hope,</hi> may be free and open for all the Planters and Merchants of this Nation to trade to, without any Duty or Incumbrances laid on them by the Company, in regard, in those Places there are no Forts, nor will the Natives suffer any to be built, nor are they needful, as hath been found true by a long Experience of Trade with the Natives of those Countries, who always treat civilly, and deal honestly with all Persons that come amongst them to Trade.</p>
            <p>The Company not being at any charge to maintain Forts or Castles in the Places, from River <hi>Vultus</hi> to Cape <hi>Good-hope,</hi> it will be a great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and a heavy Tax on the Plantations, to pay a Duty to their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, only to assist and help maintain the <hi>African</hi> Company in their Trade.</p>
            <p>The Planters being humbly of Opinion, that the Interest of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are of infinitely greater concern to be preserved, than any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a Joint-stock can pretend to.</p>
